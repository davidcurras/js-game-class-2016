## Phaser Web Games - UAI Rosario 2016.

This is a collection of web games made with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) by the students of Universidad Abierta Interamericana Sede Rosario during 2016.
This is _not_ a port of any original game, this is _not_ code conversion, this is _not_ the ROM running in an emulator. This is
a collection of experimental projects written from scratch in JavaScript using Phaser.js framework.

This project is in no way endorsed by any third party. Most images, logos, characters, dialog, plot, and other assets taken from original games 
are copyrights of third parties; I claim no ownership of any of the assets used on this repository.
